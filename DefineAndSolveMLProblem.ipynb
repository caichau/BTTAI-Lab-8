    "3. This will be a supervised learning problem, since there is a label that we are trying to predict. The \"Life Ladder\" values in the dataset are continuous, so this will be a regression problem. \n",
    "4. The features in the dataset are 'country', 'year', 'Log GDP per capita', 'Social support', 'Healthy life expectancy at birth', 'Freedom to make life choices', 'Generosity', 'Perceptions of corruption', 'Positive affect', 'Negative affect', 'Confidence in national government', 'Democratic Quality', 'Delivery Quality', 'Standard deviation of ladder by country-year', 'Standard deviation/Mean of ladder by country-year', 'GINI index (World Bank estimate)', 'GINI index (World Bank estimate), average 2000-15', 'gini of household income reported in Gallup, by wp5-year'. \n",
    "5. Since we are predicting \"Life Ladder\", higher values indicate that a people feel they are living good lives, while lower values indicate that people don't feel like their lives aren't as good as they could be. These beliefs about the lives they are living could be tied to how happy they are with the lives they are living. The aim of our machine learning model is to predict the Life Ladder score for a country, and \"happiness\" in a sense. This is important data because it reflects how happy people are with their lives. Our group felt that this model might not work as well for a company. The problem being solved doesn't feel like a product or tool to be sold. But, this may be valuable for research and policy makers. When policy makers are considering certain policies, they could predict how that would affect one of these attributes we are training on, such as Social Support. Then, use those features to make a Life Ladder prediction with the machine learning model. To understand how a certain attribute would be affected by a policy, they could create surveys to get people's input or analyze past data. Though this WHR is reported on the country level, this might also apply to the state and city level. "

For that, I'll resplit the data 85/15. 85% will be for training and cross validation and 15% for the final test. After finding the best params, I'll do a final test to see how well the model performs on the testing dataset. I'll use either MSE or RMSE to evaluate the models. "
